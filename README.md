This is my artifact for Secure Software Development module for my masters degree. Over the last 8 weeks (and counting), i have learnt the basics of python(+librarys) , HTML and
CSS. This module has really pushed me to learn something completly different and has been very hard . However through the use of Youtube tutorials, python manuals, Reddit and my fellow students
(esspessially harry) i have made my own webapp with multiple databases. 

Please note when running tests , use visual studios specified tab for tests. Otherwise this can cuase errors. 

Also note, run in this order 
SQLite_Loader.py
Mongo_Loader.py
Create_Admin.py (If you require an admin user)
Run the tests in the test folder (to check the functions)
Finally run app.py 

Open the IP address in the output terminal for app.py
